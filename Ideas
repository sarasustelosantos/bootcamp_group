- For customers who say Churn category is "Competitor" - see what is different (identify reasions why customers prefer them)

- Penetration of additional services among the customer base (e.g. Security, backup, etc)
- Satisfaction Score and Churn correlation
- Do certain services or pricing tiers lead to higher satisfaction scores?
- Determine churn rates based on contract types
- Impact of different payment methods on customer satisfaction and churn
- Do different offer bundling impact churn and customer satisfaction?
