
Briefly characterize the status of your project*

At this early stage of our data science project on telecommunications churn rate, we have successfully gathered and preprocessed the initial dataset. We have also performed some preliminary exploratory data analysis  to gain a better understanding of the data's characteristics. However, we are yet to build and evaluate predictive models for churn predition or analysis.

What have been your main challenges in the project, so far?*

Throughout the project, we've encountered several significant challenges. These include establishing effective GitHub collaboration practices, coordinating team efforts, managing code and data, conducting code reviews and ensuring reproducibility.

What insights/learnings have you achieved so far in the project?*

Despite being in the early stages, we have gained valuable insights from our initial data exploration. We a better understanding on dataframe variables and how we could mitigate errors in data analisys. 
Additionally, we've learned how to structure our GitHub repository for efficient collaboration and version control.

What do you expect will be the next steps in the project?*
Looking ahead, our next steps involve further data exploration, refining our models, and conducting in-depth analyses to develop cluster analisys or predictive churn models.
